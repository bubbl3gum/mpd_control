### INTRODUCTION
mpd_control aims to provide a fast, keyboard-driven way to interact with
the music play daemon. It uses dmenu to list artists, albums etc. It does 
not intend to provide a full replacement for graphical mpd-clients.

### USAGE
The usual way to use this script is to bind keyboard-shortcuts to its
command line arguments. 

### COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
-a, --artist 	  	search for artist, then album, then title
-t, --track 	  	search for a single track in the whole database
-p, --playlist   	search for a playlist load it
-j, --jump       	jump to another song in the current playlist
-l, --longplayer	search for album, then title
